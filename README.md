I have played this game in my childhood a lot. This game involves 2 people (in this case the computer and the user). 
Both of them take out some random number from 1 to 6 and if the number taken out by both of them matches, then the one who 
is batting is out and the game ends there but we can restart the game again (in our game batting is always given to the user). 
Series of such games continues (till the time user decides to stop) after which we see the summary of scores with each chanceâ€™s 
score in a list. 

HOPE YOU WOULD ALSO ENJOY THIS GAME AS IT IS A FUN TIME KILLER !
